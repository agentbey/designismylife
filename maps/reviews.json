        "review_text_published": "Update 3/2024: I believe in giving second chances. I think this establishment has a different team in the kitchen. I ordered some of my favorites along with some new dishes and was not impressed.\n\nStuffed Tofu - total failure the filling tasted sour and not in savory way. Picture shows four but only received three.\n\nFried Rice w/Pickled Mustard Greens - Partial failure due to the lack of flavor. And the mustard green was not pickled at all.\n\nBraised Tofu with Lemongrass Stalk - Good. Not like it was before. This was my favorite. Quality has gone down.\n\nThis is officially my last time eating here. I am super sad about this decision. üò•\n\nUpdate 1/2024: I have been back to this restaurant twice this month and each time was not able to host my friends there. I bragged so much about the food and atmosphere and was completely disappointed once we got there to not be able to eat due to an issue in the kitchen and then a private event. Both can be accepted but disappointed nonetheless.\n\nBut my issue is with the staff. I am not sure what happened from last year to now but the staff is clearly not interested in working there. The front of the house staff seems to be in another world and definitely don't have a food service attitude. I can't imagine what is happening in the back of the house.\n\nI cannot in good conscience keep championing this restaurant. They get two stars from me. I am seriously disappointed after having joyfully eaten here in the past.\n\n2023 Review\nI am declaring that this is the best plant-based restaurant in Da Nang. The food was absolutely delicious and was pleasantly plated. The proportion of the dishes matched the price point too.\n\nI've been to many restaurants here in Da Nang and generally liked them all but Nha Hang Chay Tam Chau creates an atmospheric experience that enhances the food flow. The mantras set the mood. The lighting is super colorful and the table area are uniquely designed.\n\nOverall, an upscale experience that I highly recommend.\n\nThe Banh Xeo was perfectly crisp and not oily with the right portion of fillings. A must have food sharing adventure.\n\nThe Lotus Nut Rice. Wow! A great combo to have with the Lemongrass Tofu. What a feast!\n\nThanks to the hard working chefs and the staff. I will definitely be back here for more. One thing to note, it's cash only. They don't accept credit cards.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

No matter how time passes by the food and flavor profiles don't change.\n\nThe Chef, Aye, is a master of flavors and presentation of culinary delights. If you have allergens or particular dietary restriction, Aye is able to accommodate you without sacrificing the authentic flavors. I appreciate that very much!\n\nTruly his preparations are made with love and passion.\n\nWhat you won't find here is fast food or prepared meals that have been sitting for hours and reheated.

Not oily and not watery at all!\n\nSecond, the spices were perfect, everything was balanced and create a nice harmony of flavors and textures.\n\nThis is indeed the best Vegan Khao Soi I have ever eaten. Definitely, the best in Chiang Rai.\n\nThe only thing I would add is textured mushrooms and kaffir lime leaf to give it that pungent umami flavor.\n\nVery impressive.

The team at Rahat Bakery is quite exceptional and it's reflected in their wonderful bread. Yumtastic!\n\nSuper fresh, great texture, and excellent flavor. There is nothing like a really great-tasting bread. Just five wholesome ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt and sesame seeds.\n\nI ate my first round delight with Mi Tron (Jackfruit Salad). What a nice combo. The bread is great for salads, soups, dips, and I already know some hummus and the bread would be amazing.\n\nAll I can say is this. Your bread is perfect! Keep making more.\n\nIf you are in Da Nang, do yourself a favor get over to Rahat Bakery and enjoy. (I am eating my last round now as I write this review.) As chef, I am thinking this bread would make great small pizzas. Add your sauce at home and your toppings pop into a toaster oven. Hint. Hint.

It is located your left.\n\nOnce inside you will sense the peaceful order of the space.\n\nNow the food. The menu is simple and easy to flow with. Your order at the counter, pay and your dishes will be served at your table. The system is efficient and the food is prepared promptly.\n\nI order the fried wonton, sauteed vegetables and fried noodles. Wontons are an absolute must order. The crispy texture and flavor were very good. I wish there was some spicy mustard for those.\n\nThe sauteed cabbage dish was good but only one thing, the cabbage is steamed without seasoning. However, you can do as I did mix the toppings with some soy sauce along with the cabbage. After that I tasted complete. I think ginger would have been a nice addition.\n\nThe fried noodles weren't exactly as I thought. I should have asked if they used rice noodles or wheat noodles for the preparation. I was expecting rice noodle since the dish was explain it was like pancit. With that to the side, it's was tasty and fresh. I did add soy sauce to boost the flavor.\n\nThe staff were very pleasant. The complete experience was indeed a pleasure. I hope they bring back the calamansi drink.\n\nI will go next door to Mabuhay Tea House for more food exploration.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

Love the texture and the sauce was the perfect blend of savory and sweet.\n\nThe Viet Pho was fulfilling as well. Typically, limes are served but this is the Philippines, so you get a side of calamansi.\n\nCheers to the staff for keeping the goodness flowing.\n\nI am a traveling vegan chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

        "review_text_published": "Beautiful restaurant and wonderful staff. I came here for dinner for the first time to explore several dishes.\n\nThe Bun Hue Soup is good for people who may be sensitive to the robust flavor of traditional Bun Hue. For me it was lacking and was more watered down. I've eaten vegan Bun Hue so many times that I can't count the bowls. I give it a 3 in flavor and 6 for presentation.\n\nI also ordered the Bum Mam Chay - Seafood Noodle Salad. This dish has a really great sauce with a nice portion size for one person. Super fresh ingredients. 7 in flavor and same for presentation.\n\nThe prices are really good. The two dishes and a pineapple juice cost 75,000 VND.\n\nI will come again to try the Cao Lau. Another traveler I met in Chiang Mai, Thailand stated it tastes better than what he experienced in Hoi An. Sounds like a worthy challenge. üôÇ I have a great reference for amazing Vegan Cao Lau from Hoi An. Let's go!\n\nUpdate: Went the next day for the Cao Lau. Alright, as a chef and person the studies flavor profiles, this dish was monotone. Cao Lau should cover the spectrum sour, pungent, bitter, astringent and sweet. The broth was basic soy sauce. These best plant based Cao Lau I ate was indeed in Hoi An.\n\nThis one is good but missing the full range. Vegetables were very fresh. Excellent presentation. Noodles had a nice texture. I don't think they are made fresh or as fresh as in Hoi An.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology. Check out my other reviews on Google Maps."

It has been thoroughly verified. There is milk protein in the ingredients.\n\nI would advise the previous reviewers to update their reviews so they don't confused future vegan customers. They are not 100% VEGAN. I would advise the business to not use the words plant-based, dairy-free, or vegan on the front door. It implies you are a vegan business. Also, make a note on your menu which items are vegan‚Äì free from any animal by-products. A simple letter \"V\" works.\n\nA small recommendation please post the ingredients and sugar / calorie details for those that need to manage that health wise.\n\nMuch success as your business grows and prospers.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

Nothing overstated or oversold.\n\nI appreciate honest listing. I stayed in 2.4 Queen Size Dorms which has only 4 beds on the floor. Great setup!\n\nThis has to be one of the top hostel experiences in Chiang Mai. Very modern facility with a  spacious setup. Smart layout throughout. Each section feels like your own space without feeling so cramped or stacked on top of each other.\n\nAmple storage area, perfect location of power outlets and super comfy bed. I sleep well on firm beds. Each area comes with a locker, and several places to store your gear.\n\nThere are actually black out curtains. Unlike what other places promise.\n\nThis property would be 100% perfect if it weren't for the restaurant club a few meters away. They have live music and you can hear it at night from about 22:30 - 00:30.\n\nWill I stay here again? Absolutely!!!\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

Functional without the aesthetics.\n\nWater, towel, sarong, tea, and scrub are provided for 200THB during your one hour timeframe.\n\nThai Massage\nI had one massage here that was average at best, which is typical around town. I've been a resident at one point and massage student of a few teachers in Chiang Mai.\n\nI will say getting a massage after the herbal steam sauna is good though.\n\nStaff\nGreat personalities and pleasant to communicate with.

They seem to be full of happy customers each time I've been there.\n\nAll the dishes are served with a beautiful presentation and are super colorful.\n\nNothing pretentious, just good wholesome slow cooked food made with happiness and love.\n\nBut I have to share this as a chef the Pad Thai was missing the base ingredients of all Pad Thais tamarind and palm sugar. There is a mock fish sauce made from fermented pineapple that can give this dish that umami flavor profile. I give the presentation a 9 but the flavor a 4.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology. Check out my other reviews on Google Maps."

Basically, you can see into the bunk at night when the lamps are on.\n\nThe AC works great and there is an exhaust fan as well. The bed and pillow were comfortable. I did appreciate the desk setup. That made it easy to stow my bags and toiletries.\n\nThe staff all have great personalities and are enthusiastic to take care of the customers.\n\nHonestly, I won't stay here again. I've already been to two of the best hostels in Chiang Mai. With that said I think this is the best social hostel in Chiang Mai.\n\nKhap Khun Khrap to the staff and owner.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

The bathroom tiles around the shower are bulging out due to water damage. The headboard looks beaten with damage with paint covering it.\n\nI happened to see the other neighboring rooms because the doors were open for housekeeping. And they looked better than the one I was in.\n\nI would stay here again but not in Room 210. I noticed that 209 has a completely different flooring type and the interior style looks more inviting.\n\nKeep in mind there is no soundproofing! I was lucky there weren't any noisy neighbors during the night. I could hear the person on the next room rearranging their luggage. You can hear everything.\n\nThanks again to the wonderful staff.\n\nI am a traveling vegan chef who specializes in food science and flavorology. Check out my other reviews on Google Maps."

This is a no-frills hotel and great for minimalistic travelers who need a nice location at a family-friendly establishment.\n\nThe beds are super firm just the way I like them. Clean linens and great towels. They supply towels, bottled water, soap, and shampoo.\n\nI stayed for nearly two weeks and was happy with my time there.\n\nThe only issue I had was with the bathroom function of the shower. The position is quite wrong for a wet bath of this type. You'll have to tread through water upon entering the bathroom. The water doesn't drain downwards to the drain.\n\nI would consider staying here in the future. A good option for the price."

Even the fridge can accommodate a week's worth of food.\n\nAnd to top every else the wifi is super fast. See screenshot.\n\nThe host lives on site so you don't have to deal with an absent host.

The street can get loud at night towards the weekends due to super rowdy travelers at the nearby spots on the same street. Ear plugs might be needed.\n\nThe actual guests were super conscious to not make noise in the night. I stayed on the fourth floor that has the queen size beds. Loved the design and comfort.\n\nLot of ample key card security points to assure everyone safety and camera strategically placed as well to monitor the public spaces. Community sitting area inside and in the garden.

I wouldn't have minded if the flavor profile was there.\n\nIn short, what I received didn't match what I've read here. Nice family and love the concept of home style cooking in a home.

First, the owner (Tio) of the establishment is kind and dedicated to food service.\n\nI watched her prepare several meals for customers with the same level of intention for each bowl served.\n\nAlthough, it's outside the main city area, I was lucky to pick a hotel that is in walking distance. It's a typical local Thai restaurant layout but clean. In other words nothing fancy. But don't let that stop you from coming.\n\nNow about the food. I am super pleased with the fresh pan seared wontons I ordered today. Nice range of flavors that was complimented with healthy portion sizes. Let's talk about the noodles. Wow! Very good quality and made the experience even more enjoyable. Completely satisfied.\n\nThe noodles are made inhouse and they are suitable for vegetarians. They do contain egg. The wontons are vegan.\n\nThis little shop is delivering big flavors. I'll be back for sure.\n\nI am a traveling vegan chef that specializing in food science and flavorology.

Not sure what the system is for housekeeping. It wasn't mentioned and wasn't provided.\n\nPerhaps most guests stay a night or two.\n\nThey only accept cash. Wifi was fast and consistent.

My first thought was \"This is better that some of the hotels in Chiang Mai.\" The bathrooms are very clean. There are locker with ample space for you gear. Each bed unit has it's own light and power supply with a nifty ledge to place your computer or devices. Two clean toilets, sink and showers. The room has air conditioning as well.\n\nThey provided vegetarian food for the guests. And complimentary tea, coffee, water and toast for breakfast. And tea, coffee and water anytime. A1 service from every staff member.\n\nAnd I sleep extremely well. This is sometime rare for me in other hostels. Seems like the Green Tiger attracts good people.

The food is very tasty and freshly made each opening day. They will not serve day old food.\n\nThe prices are great so they can serve everyone the community. I highly recommend Tien Sieng.\n\nThey also sell vegetarian and vegan products as well. Those that live in Chiang Mai can get all sorts of plant-based products from Taiwan.\n\nFind you way to Tien Sieng for a peaceful karma free plate.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

He was in agreement in assisting me with cancelling the booking.\n\nI hope the owner/management addresses the conditions mentioned.

There is a fresh salad bar with a nice selection of dressings. There is a soup which I found to be very tasty. And the hot bar items had enough items to accommodate everyone. The ratio of Balinese dishes to general one are balanced.\n\nThe Indonesian dishes were tasty. I can tell that the flavor profiles are geared towards Westerners. But don't let that deter you.

Got there and the only two things is fresh spring roll and salad. Good thing Tam Chau is just down the street. Not a total wasted of time. Definitely, not coming back here.\n\nNice looking macrobiotic restaurant. I hope that the hours are correct now.\n\nWent there to enjoy a large dinner with a friend but the menu was rendered to four items because they closing at 15:30 PM and not 20:30 PM as listed on the Google Map page. Perhaps they don't manage the Google Maps Business page. That is understandable. I hope it is corrected.\n\nThe waitstaff seemed to be distracted and more focused with her phone. And somewhere between placing the order and her giving it to the kitchen she didn't tell them no onions. Which I said a few times and she appeared to have acknowledge that I said no onions. The bowl came with onions and quickly taken away to have the onions picked off the top of the salad.\n\nHaving been in food service it is important to communicate to the kitchen when a customer make a request for something not to be on the dish to make certain the kitchen is aware. I recommend you having customers write down their orders. It will eliminate missing requests.\n\nIt was apparently closing time so there were no pleasantries exchanged during the 30 minutes of being there. There was one woman there appeared to be an owner. She appeared not to be in  pleasant mood. Not sure what that was about. I won't be going back.\n\nVeganism is more than just food. It should express a spirit of compassion and joy. As vegans we are here to reduced the suffering in the world. If we aren't able to do that with our interactions then what is the point."

About the room‚Ä¶\n\nRoom 202 is situated next to the elevator. Upon arrival I took note of several issues with the room. The most glaring one was the makeshift faucet handle. See photo.\n\nSome items stand out more than others but over all I am not willing to tolerate for five days seeing these fixable issues.\n\nI hope after this post goes public the management would take some time to have these items shown repaired.

Thank you J you were the best.\n\nThe pure juices were very good. We ordered the Pure Gold blend. Not sure if they produce the juices inhouse or not. I forgot to ask.\n\nI ordered the Pad Thai. It was not the way Pad Thai should be made. I am sharing these points with hope the management reads this as constructive feedback from one culinary artist to another. I have 20 years of vegan and vegetarian culinary experience.\n\nThe way this dish was prepared was more like a pasta dish with sauce and not like traditional Pad Thai.\n\nFirst, the sauce is overbearing sour due to there being too much tamarind paste. There need to be a light flavor of tamarind with and even blend of palm sugar. If not palm sugar then you can use coconut sugar. I know this is typically made with fish sauce. There is a really great alternative for fish sauce made from fermented pineapples. There is vegan \"fish sauce\" from Vietnam that is the best Nuoc Nam Chay.\n\nSecond, Pad Thai is one of the most simplest Thai dishes to prepare. I lived in Thai for five years and have taken numerous classes to learn the cuisine. I recommend someone from your team take time to learn the proper way this dish is made. Especially, the way to prepare the noodles.\n\nLastly, presentation. What was shown on the menu and what was served were two different presentations. Not very inviting. Everything was mixed together and didn't look like it was handled with care.\n\nThe staff has a lot of enthusiasm which makes this establishment a winner for personality. I think with some good direction and mastery, the meals will rank very high in the future.\n\nI am a traveling plant-based chef specializing in food science and flavorology.

I had the mochi with bean paste. Incredible flavor. And a nice finish to the meal.\n\nI wish they sold some type of beverage, like an herbal tea.\n\nThe system is efficient. Grab a plate and tongs. Choose from the wide variety of goodness. Weight the plate and pay. A find somewhere to sit and eat. You can also do a takeaway box for those on the go.\n\nLastly, the price is absolutely great!

And a bigger selection of dishes.\n\nAround 9:45 AM the food trays were just about empty. I am not sure how often they replenish the trays.\n\nHowever, I filled up on the juices and teas. Most have English on the labels. There were a few that were labeled in Thai only. I used Google Translate to sort it out.\n\nI highly recommend going to the goods shop for teas, snacks, grains, oil, body care products, etc. all priced amazingly low.\n\nPart of their mission is recycling and reuse. You will find a huge selection of second hand clothing and other donated items at super low prices.\n\nLastly, they have fresh organic produce available too. Go explore and enjoy."

Everything is made fresh each day.\n\nNo leftovers from the day before are served. Which is very difficult because they sell out daily.\n\nI highly recommend exploring all the dishes served. My top favorite is the Khao Soi. Fresh ingredients bathed in a coconut milk based with pickled cabbage and vegan mushroom based product that will dazzle the tastebuds of most omnivores. The fried noodles are very tasty and the soup has a very nice depth of flavors.\n\nThis is one of a few actual Jai restaurants in Chiang Mai that are are practitioners of  the Dao faith. They are vegan themselves and also follow the strict parameters of a satvic diet. No onion, garlic, leeks, chives, and scallions.\n\nYou can trust that they will deliver the flavors at the best price point in Chiang Mai."

It is super rich taste that has a depth of care that will satisfy your tastebuds. And the portion is healthy. So come ready to feast.\n\nYou have to also try their meaty mushroom. Chewy savory goodness. I think they prepare the best mushrooms in Chiang Mai. There is also some of the most amazing vegan sausages that are spicy and savory.\n\nThey are part of my top five must eat at restaurants in Chiang Mai.\n\nEnjoy!"

And it's is hard to determine which provides the best and consistent treatments.\n\nI've been extremely fortunate to have been introduced to this family when I first arrived in Chiang Mai back in 2013.\n\nMy first treatment was from Kru Thong (mother of Nueng, the owner). Kru Thong is a master teacher and an exceptional practitioner. I was amazed during my first visit to the shop at how fast she was able to locate my issue and release the nerve blockage. I am still amazed how she was able to do what she did by only asking one question. I later became her student to learn about their system of treatment.\n\nI am now close with the family and it's an honor to write this recommendation for this business.\n\nBasically, don't miss their services whenever you are in Chiang Mai. They are one of few businesses that have maintain the authentic healing practice of Traditional Thai Therapeutic Massage treatment.\n\nThe facility is very clean and serene. The staff are all well trained and dedicated to their customers healing.\n\nThey also have a wide range of certified practitioners to manage different body types and conditions. Their healing balms are really good too. I also recommend that herbal ball treatment service. Helps relieve muscle tension and body stress.\n\nI highly recommend scheduling a two hour treatment because one hour is not enough.\n\nThis business is a hidden gem in Chiang Mai. See for yourself and receive the goodness. I've introduced lots of people to Thong Nom Nueng."

No bland food here at all.\n\nMust try the Khao Soi. Very good flavor and presentation. See photo. Also, the vegan sausages are really tasty. Not a fan of the mushroom balls. They aren't very flavorful. But they don't make these.\n\nYou can also get rice with a selection of prepared dishes for a really great price. Excellent value overall.\n\nThey have a nice selection of snacks as well. The owners are calm and keep the atmosphere very peaceful."

I ate one potato and I couldn't subject myself to eating any more. I am a chef and I know when potatoes have been sitting a few days and reheated.\n\nIt tastes like it looks (see photo). I say pull it off your menu since you don't make it fresh. It's not good.\n\nI brought this to the attention of the owner in English and in Thai. And my observation is correct. It's not made fresh.\n\nI can only recommend the one thing that I have ordered three times now and that is the papaya salad.\n\nGood luck and enjoy.\n\nHead up on the orange juice that says it's 100%. This is from an outside vendor. It definitely has sugar. It was super sweet beyond normal sweetness. I had to dilute with half water. Heads up to anyone that has a sugar free diet. I was told it had no sugar when I asked."

But there is a small washing machine on the 2nd floor along with irons and ironing boards. And a refrigerator and microwave available. Huge plus.\n\nI could tell this was once a really nice property. But based on my room and overall appearance there are lots of upgrades needed and a few items in the room for convenience would be great.\n\nHere's a list of recommendations for consideration:\n\nHave one dedicated plug for electronics so guests can charge phones, cameras and other devices when the magnetic key card is not in use. One electrical socket with USB terminals.\n\nAdd a luggage rack or table under the clothing rack.\n\nA way to dim the lights would be nice.\n\nOther than that the staff was friendly and helpful."

Because some vegan restaurants in Vietnam don't have a wide range of flavors with certain dishes. So they all start to taste the same.\n\nThere was a careful balance with the sauces as well. One big distinction that sets this restaurant apart from the others is that they thin out the base vegetarian sauces so it's not overbearing. In other words they don't use it straight from the bottle like some places.\n\nI recommend the curry and rice dish. Very tasty. I do wish it had a few more vegetables.\n\nOver all, it was really good. The servers were very polite and attentive."

She is also the other co-owner.\n\nI did a walk in. I was asked to wait for about 10 minutes. Tam worked on me for about 10 minutes then left to attend to another customer. I wish I was told that Tam wasn't available. I still don't get why Tam didn't just say come back later. The other masseuse had zero technique / experience. 3-Star Experience.\n\nI'm trained and teach massage.

I was recently reading a Jain book and felt strongly to search online for Jain Temple Hyderabad. It took me only a few seconds to locate it.\n\nI want to thanks everyone for welcoming me to this auspicious Jain Temple. This was my first time visiting a Jain Temple. The energy was not only uplifting but also I felt something that I cannot put into words. The best I can say is pure energy and devotion.\n\nI want to thank the gentleman (I pray that you remember me) that provided me the address to the Jain Temple in Aler. I didn't return as quickly to India as planned to thank you in person. Dear sir, thank you for your generosity and heart.\n\nI would love to reconnect with you and share my experience receiving darshan and the few english books there on Jainism and specifically Preksha Meditation.\n\nI know it must have been very odd for a foreigner from the USA to arrive at your temple doorsteps without an invitation or full insight of Jainism. As I shared, I want to learn more. And you were honest in sharing one of the Jain treasured sites.\n\nAlso, a big thank you to the young men that were generous in accepting me in the space and making sure I ate well. (The food was indeed blessed and taste divine.)\n\nI hope someone from the Jain Temple reads this and finds a way to contact me. My humble apologies that it took this long for me to reach you.\n\nJai Mahavir!\n\n#agentbey"

See number 2.\n\n2 ‚Äì The gear shift lever issue is back.\n\n3 ‚Äì During a air filter change I found orange peels in the carburetor. This was the last location that I surrendered my vehicle for repair that I was out of my sight. Only someone with ill intention would do something like that.\n\nTo all customers that have place their trust in this dealership. Don't! Check your vehicle thoroughly before leaving. Have another technician follow up with the repairs. My biggest regret was going to this dealer because I am not a resident and unable to confront them in person.\n\nI now have two issues to manage. The gear shift lever repair for s \"second\" time and to have the carburetor serviced.\n\nOriginal: Very active dealership. Great courteous team. Came to get service on a recall. Was out in 1.5 hours. Not bad."

I've eaten at just about every vegan restaurant in Beijing and Su Tiger was the one I craved for the most. The dedication of the chefs was very impressive.\n\nThe presentation of the plates were visually delectable. Since I was living in Beijing, I had the opportunity to ordered everything on the menu.\n\nMouthwatering goodness and excellent quality. My mouth is watering thousand of kilometers away.\n\nI want to thank the staff from my heart. You all were such a blessing to me. It's beyond words.

This is a huge plus, they have self service dumping stations along with overnight parking. Grant it that it's first come first served. But there is water and electricity.\n\nThe store design is well laid out. Plenty of items in stock too.\n\nMy last purchase was a personal safe.\n\nThe staff is super friendly and in my opinion honest.\n\nRecommend anyone in the area to head over there for all your outdoor needs and RV adventures."

The mayo is probably the best thing about it. I would have been happy to have that mayo and lettuce with tomato than whatever that \"OG Fake Chicken\" is made of. Actually, I already know. Frozen slab of tofu in an uneventful batter coating. I cannot prove this but based on customer photos of the same sandwich I get the impression the fryer oil needs to be changed.\n\nIf I weren't on the road driving I would have gone back to express my distaste in person.\n\nIt would be unvegan of me to hate but I can say I disliked this food experience."

Again take ALL trash with you.\n\nThese locations are our national treasures. They are only valuable when we treat them with care.\n\nMake certain you have good tires and be alert. Right after the single lane bridge the 7 miles road to the campsite is all gravel. The day I was going to up there were two trucks with flat tires.\n\nAnd as far as cell expect none. Enjoy nature."

The machine look new!\n\nAs a traveler this is very important. Because sometimes I may drive to a laundromat and it's smells bad and dirty.\n\nThe prices are very good too. You can pay with card or use quarters. Very convenient all around.\n\nThe bathrooms were clean as well.\n\nIt has a family vibe and feels like is operated by people that actual care. That makes a world of a difference.\n\nThe dryers are 25 cents for 4 minutes. In my experience the dryer high temperature took awhile to heat up. Machines 21 and 23.\n\nPlease continue being awesome.

I was told they can make without.\n\nBut I discover later that there was garlic in the curry. I had an allergic reaction. Obviously, I didn't die. But when you are in food service you really have to be mindful of food allergens.\n\nThe fact is that it would have taken only  10 seconds to read the label. I could have easily ordered another dish.\n\nI called the next day to inquire about the ingredients of the curry paste and the woman said, \"yes, it's has garlic.\"\n\nI strongly advise management and staff to be more informed of products ingredients they are using.\n\nMore on garlic allergy:\nhttps://www.healthline.com/health/garlic-allergy"

I had a great server and soon as I heard him speak I was transported back to my time in Thailand.\n\nAs a vegan chef I am big on authenticity and flavors. The vegan Thai Ice Tea was just right. The flavor was as I expected and remembered from living in Thailand.\n\nThe fresh summer rolls we're almost a full meal. Very robust in flavor and then sauce was absolutely yummy.\n\nI ordered the Pad Thai which was good but a bit different than what I know Pad Thai to be. The rice noodles appeared to have been cooked in water first which made them wet and brittle.\n\nThe consistency of the noodle should be more gummy which holds most of the flavor since it get cook in a combo of soy sauce, tamarind, and palm sugar in it's dry state. Typically, Pad Thai is served with a slice of lime and toasted peanuts.\n\nI did ask for lime but got lemon. Not the same but what can you do.\n\nI would definitely eat here again and mostly likely will. I am curious to try the other dishes."

It's modern. It's fresh. It's inviting.\n\nIn other words, everything is working and it's well lit.\n\nEven the gas station looks updated and much more fresher looking than any other one I've ever been to.\n\nBut Sam's Club would not be Sam's Club without the people, the actual employees, and the management.\n\nAs I walked around the store I saw the different employees and they look genuinely happy like they wanted to be there and it created a friendly atmosphere.\n\nAnd I got a sense that there is a strong presence of teamwork throughout the whole establishment.\n\nThis is probably the first time I ever wrote a review this long for Sam's Club.\n\nKudos to the manager of this location because it takes a good manager to lead a good team and to create such an atmosphere that's to me that is very vibrant and just genuinely open.\n\nI actually wished I lived in this city so I could go to this Sam's Club. Lol.\n\nI just want to say thank you to all the Sam's Club team and the management for all you do."

Has a sleep zone, movie theater, a well laid-out restaurant, reclining chairs, and even a children's play area.\n\nThis is a family oriented business. During my visit I saw children having a good time while the parents relaxed in comfort. A few people working on their computers. And most were just relaxing.\n\nI stayed for 24 hours and was completely satisfied with the services.\n\nIf you are deciding which Korean Spa to visit just take my advice come here and experience the best of the best that Georgia has to offer.\n\nSpa Land is the best Korean Spa in GA. You don't want to miss it. Also, they have great package deals on guest tickets. Ask when you go there.\n\nSuper clean family-oriented facility. And the wifi service is super fast.\n\nAt the time of this review Dload = 76.49 Upload = 39.15"

I can't wait to get back their to order other items from the menu.\n\nI had the Tofu Sambar with Satay Sauce and the Curry Laksa. I really enjoyed the Curry Laksa. It had the right amount of seasonings and spices. It also reminded me of Khao Soy."

It's basically parked for 5-6 days out of the week. And I didn't have a leak prior to the oil change service.\n\nI was keeping track of this leak and tried to visit several mechanics to confirm what the issue might be. I did take the van back to this location and the attendant confirmed it was transmission fluid leaking.\n\nFinally, located a mechanic with a lift that could inspect the issue. The rubber hoses on the Transmission Cooler Unit were blown out most likely to the transmission fluid being overfilled.\n\nIt cost me $488 for the repair! I am not a happy camper. This is an unexpected expense that really hurts my wallet. That doesn't include the oil service of $58.31.\n\nI don't have a trend of leaving poor rating for businesses but I am feeling the pain of someone inability to pay attention.\n\nORIGINAL REVIEW:\nThe best in customer service. Love their pitstop style service. Makes huge difference."

And the cost would be $900 total. An OEM transmission cooling unit would have to be ordered from a dealer and that would take up to a week.\n\nI said I would take a few days to consider. And as recommended make sure to check the transmission fluid.\n\nToday, I checked the lines from the transmission pan to the radiator. And there are zero breaks or leaks.\n\nI looked at the transmission cooling unit and it is dry as dirt. No leaks as I was informed.\n\nI focused back to the area where the fluid appears on the ground. And to my surprise the intake line just needs to be tightened. How the technicians missed that is beyond me."

I ordered a container to go for my long ride back east. Also, the sesame kale and Asian salad ‚Äì yumtastic!\n\nPortions, prices and location is great. Completely satisfied.\n\nI have only one recommendation, it wasn‚Äôt a deal breaker, but the brown rice was a little dry.

The bathroom aren't cleaned each day.\n‚Ä¢ AC didn't work for the days reserved. Problem related to electrical issues.\n‚Ä¢ Hot water barely got warm. Problem related to electrical issues.\n‚Ä¢ Very attentive staff.\n‚Ä¢ One night music when on until 11:30 PM. Not sure if this is a Friday night thing.\n‚Ä¢ Food I don't know. After looking at the kitchen I declined.\n\nPersonal recommendation is if you plan to stay there make it one night tops. I really wish the place was cleaner. The wifi internet speed is very good. This is a huge plus for travelers. Especially, in India. Many places promised fast but fall short. Zostel gets two thumbs up for fast internet."

I think as a tourist you need to have some distance between the tourist areas and where you rest.\n\nI went out to look at several hotels near the Ghat and I thought that many of them were substandard. And other great hotel but location was not good. The closer you go into the Ghats it get congested and extremely filthy.\n\nSo having found the location by chance was a gift to my time there. When I came back to my room I felt peaceful to be away from all the hagglers, smells, dust, dirt and feces.\n\nThe staff is very accommodating. I felt well taking care of during my stay. The management made sure in several instances I was happy with my time there. Happy to provide details of where to go and best options.\n\nThere is a very sacred Hanuman Temple - Sankat Mochan Temple just in walking distance. You can actually walk to Assi Ghat from this hotel. Along the way you will find local vendors and some really good fruit blends, chai, fruits, juices, etc. All of which I enjoyed several times a day.\n\nThe room size is very nice and bathroom is western style. The room is clean. If you aren't use to the heat I would recommend getting an A/C room. The bed is very huge king size bed. Three people could actually sleep on the bed.\n\nI came in late from the airport and the staff took care to make sure I had a room. The provided quick service in making sure I got to my room. I got the cold bottle of water I ordered within a few minutes.\n\nI would recommend to travelers to serious consider this hotel despite the distance. Peace of mind is more valuable than a location. And as others have share this is the cleanest area of the city."

Traveling in Asia and discovering a bathtub is such a treat.\n\nThere was one small problem the bathtub stopper didn't work. That was remedied by stuffing a small towel into the drain. The breakfast is average but there is no official seating and tables yet. This is a new hotel. It appears there is something there for everyone to eat. The one issue I had with the management not informing me that the room aren't cleaned unless you ask them. It was stated this is policy and directed me to a post on the other side of the counter.\n\nI asked them to please inform guests when they check in. They were nice to bring up sheet and towels. And provide another bottle of water. During check out the managing staff member eagerly asked me how was my stay and if there was any recommendations. I share the same sentiment about the cleaning room policy. He took offense to my simple suggestion and wanted to challenge me with a set of reasons. I politely asked him to consider.\n\nThe WIFI in this establishment is super slow. If you need continuous access and speed then you may want to book another hotel. I hope the manager will take on the practice of notifying guest of the cleaning room policy."

The breakfast buffet is awesome. Lots of selections and even vegetarian options free from animal products made to order. Good location and on the route to Angkor Wat sites. Highly recommend!"
